# Earthquake-project
I have a profound interest in the field of disaster management, which is why I chose to study Disaster Management during my first and second semesters as a part of the Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS) curriculum. Additionally, I am an avid data science enthusiast, and this passion led me to embark on an exploratory data analysis project focused on global earthquake data.

In the pursuit of this project, I harnessed substantial datasets and employed various analytical techniques. The core dataset for my analysis was sourced from the USGS Earthquake Database(https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php). By applying the skills I've acquired, particularly in the areas of CSV file manipulation, and utilizing libraries such as Basemap, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and fundamental statistical methods, I aspired to uncover valuable insights about earthquakes.

Each section of my analysis is structured around a specific question, highlighted in bold, that aims to shed light on various aspects of earthquake occurrences and characteristics."
